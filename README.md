# FlashCable (WIP)

Flash over ActionCable, a Rails::Engine.

For fancy, SPA-style user notifications, just assign Flash normally in your controllers. FlashCable will intercept them at the middleware layer and deliver them via ActionCable.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'flash-cable'
```

And then execute:
```bash
$ bundle
```

## Usage

Assign Flash normally in your controllers. (more details to come..)
